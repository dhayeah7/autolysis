## Analysis Insights

### Correlation Analysis
We performed a correlation analysis to understand relationships between numeric variables. 

We identified the following strong correlations:
- **overall** and **quality**: Correlation of 0.83
- **overall** and **repeatability**: Correlation of 0.51
- **quality** and **overall**: Correlation of 0.83
- **repeatability** and **overall**: Correlation of 0.51

### Clustering Analysis
We applied K-means clustering to identify patterns in the data:
- **Number of Clusters**: 3
- **Cluster Distribution**: [1315, 568, 769]

## Recommendations
1. Review the correlation matrix to understand variable relationships
2. Examine the clustering visualization to identify potential groupings or segments in your data
3. Consider further in-depth analysis of the identified clusters and highly correlated variables
